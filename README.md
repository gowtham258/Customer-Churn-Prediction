## üìä Features & Screenshots

### 1. Churn Trends

* **Bar Chart**: Displays churn rate (percentage of customers who left) by `tenure_group` (0‚Äì12, 13‚Äì24, 25‚Äì48, 49‚Äì60, 60+ months).
* **Line Chart**: Plots churn rate across each month of raw `tenure` (0‚Äì72+ months), illustrating how churn probability changes over time.

### 2. High-Risk Customer Groups

* **Churn by Contract Type**: Shows churn rates for ‚ÄúMonth-to-month‚Äù, ‚ÄúOne year‚Äù, and ‚ÄúTwo year‚Äù contract customers.
* **Churn by Payment Method**: Horizontal bar chart comparing churn rates across payment methods (e.g., Electronic Check, Mailed Check, Bank Transfer, Credit Card).

### 3. Model Accuracy & Performance

* **Classification Report**: Dash DataTable listing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for ‚ÄúNo Churn‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúChurn‚Äù, plus macro/weighted averages.
* **Confusion Matrix**: 2√ó2 heatmap annotated with true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
* **ROC Curve**: Line plot of True Positive Rate vs. False Positive Rate, with AUC displayed in the title.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure & Key Functions

* **`load_and_preprocess()`**

  * Reads the raw CSV
  * Converts and imputes `TotalCharges`
  * Drops `customerID`
  * Binarizes `Churn`
  * Creates `tenure_group` categories

* **`build_preprocessor()`**

  * Defines a `ColumnTransformer` that:

    * Median-imputes & standardizes numeric features (`tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`)
    * Mode-imputes & one-hot encodes all other categorical columns

* **`train_model()`**

  * Splits into train/test (80/20, stratified by `Churn`)
  * Upsamples minority class (Churn=1) in training set
  * Fits `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)`
  * Returns model, test data, predictions, classification report dict, confusion matrix, ROC curve (FPR, TPR), and AUC

* **Dash Layout & Callbacks**

  * Two multi-select dropdowns: id=`tenure-filter` and id=`contract-filter`
  * Four `dcc.Graph` components (IDs:
    `churn-by-tenure-group`, `churn-over-tenure-months`, `churn-by-contract`, `churn-by-payment-method`)
  * One callback‚Äî`update_charts`‚Äîlistening on both dropdowns:

    * Filters the raw DataFrame (`df_raw`) by selected tenure groups and contract types
    * Recomputes and returns four Plotly figures for sections 1 & 2
